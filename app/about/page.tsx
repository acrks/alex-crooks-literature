      <p>Hello there! My name is Alex Crooks, and I am a former political staffer and current software engineer who decided to turn his skill for software development and passion for writing into a website.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Since I can remember, I've loved to write stories. Sometimes they borrowed heavily from other IP (thank you to the fine people at Nintendo for giving me so much Pokemon content to write about). This love for writing has always been present in my life, from in school when I failed a standardized test by trying to write a story about an alien come to Earth, instead of writing an essay, to writing for , to now hosting my own music blog</p>
